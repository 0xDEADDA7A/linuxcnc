altkins -- demo of alternate kinematics selection
    
altkins.c implements two kinematics methods controlled by halpin:
  altkins.kins-method:

  k0:  j0-->x, j1-->y, j2-->z
  k1:  j0-->y, j1-->x, j2-->z (switches joints for x and y)

Notes:

1) All kinematics methods (k0,k1) report as KINEMATICS_BOTH

2) All joints must be homed before world moves (GCODE or MDI)

3) When the kinematics method is toggled, the current world
   joint (j0,j1,j2) values are preserved so there would be
   no bump in the prime movers (motors) for each joint.

   The world coordinates (x,y,z) are also preserved at the
   transition of kinematics methods.

   Consequently, both the forward and the inverse kinematics
   become dependent on the position value in effect when
   the kinematics method is changed.
