Motion is a realtime component.  It receives Motion commands via shared
memory from Task using the emcmotController() function, computes the
trajectory, and emits a time-series of joint positions to HAL using the
emcmotCommandHandler() function.

SAM, the Standalone Motion program, is a userspace program that uses
the same code as Motion, but in a framework that is more convenient
for testing.
